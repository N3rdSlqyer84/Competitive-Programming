Her

She stood there, looking at me.
She stood tall in the wind; her hair, flowing.
She didn’t know what to say.
She was beautiful, like god sent a gift to me.

Her eyes, hazel, like shining gold, brightening my heart.
Her hair, wavy, like the waves slowly eroding the stones.
Her lips, blood red, like the blood she was going to fill my body with.
Her skin, smooth, like how I wish to be when I approached her.

The eyes, they looked at mine.
The hair, all over my face.
The lips, I can feel them now.
Her skin, tightly gripping mine.

Her eyes, looking deeply at me.
Her waist, between my hands.
Her lips, on top of mine.
Her arms, right around me.

Those same eyes, glaring at me, beginning to be annoyed.
The same hair, they became the tissue used to wipe tears.
The same lips, no longer able find be mine.
The same arms, around the body of somebody else.

Those gleaming eyes, now full of hatred.
The wavy hair, like slashes from a blade.
The same lips, a reminiscent of blood from the wounds we delivered.
The same arms, now able to wield weapons.

She looked at me, standing there.
The wind still blows the same way.
She still couldn’t say anything.
But this time, I looked away first.
